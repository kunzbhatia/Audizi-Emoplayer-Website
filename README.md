## Audizi Emotion Music Player Website Project

## Description:
The Audizi Emotion Music Player Website is an innovative web application that combines the functionalities of a music player with deep learning technology to analyze the emotions of the user and curate playlists based on their emotional state. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Django web framework for the frontend and backend development. Additionally, deep learning libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow are employed to perform emotion analysis on the user's facial expressions, allowing the music player to provide a more personalized and emotionally relevant music experience.

## Key Features:
1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create an account and log in to access personalized features, including saved playlists, favorites, and emotion analysis data.

2. **Music Library**: The application offers an extensive music library, where users can explore and search for their favorite songs and artists. The music database can be managed through the Django backend.

3. **Music Playback**: Users can play, pause, skip, and control the volume of songs they select from the music library. The music player interface is intuitive and user-friendly.

4. **Emotion Analysis**: The project integrates OpenCV and TensorFlow to analyze the user's emotions in real-time using the webcam. This is achieved by capturing and processing the facial expressions of the user, providing insights into their emotional state.

5. **Emotion-based Playlist Curation**: Based on the user's emotion analysis, the music player generates playlists tailored to their current emotional state. For example, if the user is feeling happy, the player will curate a playlist of upbeat and joyful songs.

6. **Emotion History**: The application keeps track of the user's emotion history, allowing them to view their emotional patterns over time and the corresponding music they listened to during those moments.

7. **Favorites and Playlists**: Users can create personalized playlists and mark songs as favorites for quick access.

8. **User Interaction**: The application incorporates interactive features, such as liking and sharing playlists, collaborating with other users on playlist creation, and leaving comments on songs.

## Tech Stack:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For building the frontend user interface and user interactions.
- Django Web Framework: For backend development, database management, and user authentication.
- OpenCV: Used for facial expression detection and emotion analysis through webcam input.
- TensorFlow: Employed for training and deploying deep learning models to predict user emotions based on facial expressions.
